# Topple

Welcome to **Topple**! 🎨🟦🟧🟩

Topple is a colourful, physics-powered block stacking game where your only goal is to build the tallest most wobbly tower you can. Drag, drop and stack a parade of vibrant shapes: squares, triangles, rectangles. Then watch gravity do its thing. Will your tower stand proud, or come tumbling down in a rainbow mess?

**Features**

- Drag and drop blocks to stack
- Realistic physics: blocks tumble, teeter and topple
- Quick to play
